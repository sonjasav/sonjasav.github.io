I am a doctoral student at the University of Helsinki studying how technological development reshapes political behavior. I am currently working on my dissertation, which focuses on social movements. Specifically, I focus on how movements strategically use opportunities presented by technological development first, to achieve their objectives and second, to adapt to fluctuating political contexts. The openness of the political context is a key factor in defining how freely and visibly movements can use available technologies to facilitate their activities, as technological development has also re-equipped powerholders intending to repress or obfuscate dissent. Prior to my PhD, I received my Master's degree in Political Science from the University of Helsinki, where I also worked as a teaching and research assistant. In my masterâ€™s thesis, I studied how political parties and the climate movement interacted in social media throughout elections in 2019.
