I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki studying how media systems shape the strategies of social movements. My research focuses on how social movements are shaped by and adjust to open and closed media systems, and on the other hand tactically use opportunities provided by social media and technological development to operate in both national and global media systems. Prior to my PhD, I received my Master's degree in Political Science from the University of Helsinki, where I also worked as a teaching and research assistant.
